# Miscellaneous Programs written to further my learning #

These are miscellaneous programs I write in my personal time to further my learning. I plan on merging all of my older repositories into this one in the close future to show all of the work that I have either programmed or pair-programmed.

I spend a lot of time with new and old technologies/languages, trying to understand more and improve my cognitive speed when it comes to picking up new things. So far I've taught myself Node.js, Rails, API creation/consumption, Python, Java, JS, Ruby, and many other assisting technologies.



## Languages ##

* Java
* Javascript
* Ruby
* Python (to be merged)
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Technologies ##

* Rails
* Node
* Meteor
